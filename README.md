**RGB Mode:** Toggle the RGB button to enable vibrant, randomized colors for particles and a dark background.
**Black Hole Effect:** Holding the Vortex button for 3 seconds creates a black hole, drawing particles toward the center.
**Responsive Design**: Particles adjust dynamically to window resizing, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
